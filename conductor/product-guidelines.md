# Product Guidelines - Food & Water Tracker

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging & Supportive:** Communication should focus on positive reinforcement. Celebrate small wins and provide gentle encouragement when targets are missed.
- **Friendly & Casual:** Use approachable, human-centric language. The app should feel like a helpful companion rather than a clinical tool.
- **Core Values:**
    - **Empowerment:** Provide users with clear, actionable data to help them own their health journey.
    - **Consistency:** Emphasize the importance of daily habits and streaks as the foundation for long-term health.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles
- **Minimalist Icon-Driven Interface:** Prioritize intuitive, modern icons over heavy text. Use visual metaphors to make the interface self-explanatory and reduce cognitive load.
- **Micro-animations for Feedback:** Every significant user action (logging water, completing a meal) should be acknowledged with a subtle, satisfying animation. These micro-interactions provide a sense of progress and polish.
- **Hierarchy of Information:**
    - **Progress-First Dashboard:** The immediate focus is always on current progress versus daily goals.
    - **Clean Typography:** Ensure high legibility with ample whitespace around data points.
- **Color Usage:** Use a clean, modern palette where color is used functionally to indicate progress (e.g., green for goal completion, blue for hydration).

## User Experience (UX) Standards
- **Low-Friction Entry:** Every primary action (log water, log food) should be achievable with minimal taps.
- **Immediate Gratification:** Use visual cues (filling bars, pop animations) to provide instant feedback for positive behaviors.
- **Mobile-Optimized:** Design specifically for touch interactions and haptic-aware feedback where appropriate for the Android platform.
